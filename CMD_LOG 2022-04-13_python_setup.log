DESCRIPTION
     The ping utility uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to
     elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.  ECHO_REQUEST datagrams
     (``pings'') have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a ``struct timeval'' and
     then an arbitrary number of ``pad'' bytes used to fill out the packet.  The
     options are as follows:

     -A      Audible.  Output a bell (ASCII 0x07) character when no packet is
             received before the next packet is transmitted.  To cater for round-
             trip times that are longer than the interval between transmissions,
             further missing packets cause a bell only if the maximum number of
             unreceived packets has increased.

     -a      Audible.  Include a bell (ASCII 0x07) character in the output when
             any packet is received.  This option is ignored if other format
             options are present.

     -b boundif
             Bind the socket to interface boundif for sending.  This option is an
             Apple addition.

     -C      Prohibit the socket from using the cellular network interface.  This
             option is an Apple addition.

     -c count
             Stop after sending (and receiving) count ECHO_RESPONSE packets.  If
             this option is not specified, ping will operate until interrupted.
             If this option is specified in conjunction with ping sweeps, each
             sweep will consist of count packets.

     -D      Set the Don't Fragment bit.

     -d      Set the SO_DEBUG option on the socket being used.

     -f      Flood ping.  Outputs packets as fast as they come back or one hun-
             dred times per second, whichever is more.  For every ECHO_REQUEST
             sent a period ``.'' is printed, while for every ECHO_REPLY received
             a backspace is printed.  This provides a rapid display of how many
             packets are being dropped.  Only the super-user may use this option.
             This can be very hard on a network and should be used with caution.

     -G sweepmaxsize
             Specify the maximum size of ICMP payload when sending sweeping
             pings.  This option is required for ping sweeps.

     -g sweepminsize
             Specify the size of ICMP payload to start with when sending sweeping
             pings.  The default value is 0.

     -h sweepincrsize
             Specify the number of bytes to increment the size of ICMP payload
             after each sweep when sending sweeping pings.  The default value is
             1.

     -I iface
             Source multicast packets with the given interface address.  This
             flag only applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.

     -i wait
             Wait wait seconds between sending each packet.  The default is to
             wait for one second between each packet.  The wait time may be frac-
             tional, but only the super-user may specify values less than 0.1
             second.  This option is incompatible with the -f option.

     -k trafficclass
             Specifies the traffic class to use for sending ICMP packets.  The
             supported traffic classes are BK_SYS, BK, BE, RD, OAM, AV, RV, VI,
             VO and CTL.  By default ping uses the control traffic class (CTL).
             This option is an Apple addition.

     -K netservicetype
             Specifies the network service type to use for sending ICMP packets.
             The supported network service type are BK_SYS, BK, BE, RV, AV, RD,
             OAM, VI, SIG and VO.  Note this overrides the default traffic class
             (-k can still be specified after -K to use both).  This option is an
             Apple addition.

     -L      Suppress loopback of multicast packets.  This flag only applies if
             the ping destination is a multicast address.

     -l preload
             If preload is specified, ping sends that many packets as fast as
             possible before falling into its normal mode of behavior.  Only the
             super-user may use this option.

     -M mask | time
             Use ICMP_MASKREQ or ICMP_TSTAMP instead of ICMP_ECHO.  For mask,
             print the netmask of the remote machine.  Set the
             net.inet.icmp.maskrepl MIB variable to enable ICMP_MASKREPLY.  For
             time, print the origination, reception and transmission timestamps.

     -m ttl  Set the IP Time To Live for outgoing packets.  If not specified, the
             kernel uses the value of the net.inet.ip.ttl MIB variable.

     -n      Numeric output only.  No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic
             names for host addresses.

     -o      Exit successfully after receiving one reply packet.

     -P policy
             policy specifies IPsec policy for the ping session.  For details
             please refer to ipsec(4) and ipsec_set_policy(3).

     -p pattern
             You may specify up to 16 ``pad'' bytes to fill out the packet you
             send.  This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a
             network.  For example, ``-p ff'' will cause the sent packet to be
             filled with all ones.

     -Q      Somewhat quiet output.  Don't display ICMP error messages that are
             in response to our query messages.  Originally, the -v flag was
             required to display such errors, but -v displays all ICMP error mes-
             sages.  On a busy machine, this output can be overbearing.  Without
             the -Q flag, ping prints out any ICMP error messages caused by its
             own ECHO_REQUEST messages.

     -q      Quiet output.  Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at
             startup time and when finished.

     -R      Record route.  Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the ECHO_REQUEST
             packet and displays the route buffer on returned packets.  Note that
...skipping...
             host through an interface that has no route through it (e.g., after
             the interface was dropped by routed(8)).

     -S src_addr
             Use the following IP address as the source address in outgoing pack-
             ets.  On hosts with more than one IP address, this option can be
             used to force the source address to be something other than the IP
             address of the interface the probe packet is sent on.  If the IP
             address is not one of this machine's interface addresses, an error
             is returned and nothing is sent.

     -s packetsize
             Specify the number of data bytes to be sent.  The default is 56,
             which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8
             bytes of ICMP header data.  This option cannot be used with ping
             sweeps.

     -T ttl  Set the IP Time To Live for multicasted packets.  This flag only
             applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.

     -t timeout
             Specify a timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of how
             many packets have been received.

     -v      Verbose output.  ICMP packets other than ECHO_RESPONSE that are
             received are listed.

     -W waittime
             Time in milliseconds to wait for a reply for each packet sent.  If a
             reply arrives later, the packet is not printed as replied, but con-
             sidered as replied when calculating statistics.

     -z tos  Use the specified type of service.

     --apple-connect
             Connects the socket to the destination address.  This option is an
             Apple addition.

     --apple-time
             Prints the time a packet was received.  This option is an Apple
             addition.

     When using ping for fault isolation, it should first be run on the local

             This option is an Apple addition.

     -K netservicetype
             Specifies the network service type to use for sending ICMP packets.
             The supported network service type are BK_SYS, BK, BE, RV, AV, RD,
             OAM, VI, SIG and VO.  Note this overrides the default traffic class
             (-k can still be specified after -K to use both).  This option is an
             Apple addition.

     -L      Suppress loopback of multicast packets.  This flag only applies if
             the ping destination is a multicast address.

     -l preload
             If preload is specified, ping sends that many packets as fast as
             possible before falling into its normal mode of behavior.  Only the
             super-user may use this option.

     -M mask | time
             Use ICMP_MASKREQ or ICMP_TSTAMP instead of ICMP_ECHO.  For mask,
             print the netmask of the remote machine.  Set the
             net.inet.icmp.maskrepl MIB variable to enable ICMP_MASKREPLY.  For
             time, print the origination, reception and transmission timestamps.

     -m ttl  Set the IP Time To Live for outgoing packets.  If not specified, the
             kernel uses the value of the net.inet.ip.ttl MIB variable.

     -n      Numeric output only.  No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic
             names for host addresses.

     -o      Exit successfully after receiving one reply packet.

     -P policy
             policy specifies IPsec policy for the ping session.  For details
             please refer to ipsec(4) and ipsec_set_policy(3).

     -p pattern
             You may specify up to 16 ``pad'' bytes to fill out the packet you
             send.  This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a
             network.  For example, ``-p ff'' will cause the sent packet to be
             filled with all ones.

     -Q      Somewhat quiet output.  Don't display ICMP error messages that are
             in response to our query messages.  Originally, the -v flag was
             required to display such errors, but -v displays all ICMP error mes-
             sages.  On a busy machine, this output can be overbearing.  Without
             the -Q flag, ping prints out any ICMP error messages caused by its
             own ECHO_REQUEST messages.

     -q      Quiet output.  Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at
             startup time and when finished.

     -R      Record route.  Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the ECHO_REQUEST
             packet and displays the route buffer on returned packets.  Note that
             the IP header is only large enough for nine such routes; the
             traceroute(8) command is usually better at determining the route
             packets take to a particular destination.  If more routes come back
             than should, such as due to an illegal spoofed packet, ping will
             print the route list and then truncate it at the correct spot.  Many
             hosts ignore or discard the RECORD_ROUTE option.

     -r      Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an
             attached network.  If the host is not on a directly-attached net-
             work, an error is returned.  This option can be used to ping a local
             host through an interface that has no route through it (e.g., after
             the interface was dropped by routed(8)).

     -S src_addr
             Use the following IP address as the source address in outgoing pack-
             ets.  On hosts with more than one IP address, this option can be
             used to force the source address to be something other than the IP
             address of the interface the probe packet is sent on.  If the IP
             address is not one of this machine's interface addresses, an error
             is returned and nothing is sent.

     -s packetsize
             Specify the number of data bytes to be sent.  The default is 56,
             which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8
             bytes of ICMP header data.  This option cannot be used with ping
             sweeps.

     -T ttl  Set the IP Time To Live for multicasted packets.  This flag only
             applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.

     -t timeout
             Specify a timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of how
             many packets have been received.

     -v      Verbose output.  ICMP packets other than ECHO_RESPONSE that are
             received are listed.

     -W waittime
             Time in milliseconds to wait for a reply for each packet sent.  If a
             reply arrives later, the packet is not printed as replied, but con-
             sidered as replied when calculating statistics.

     -z tos  Use the specified type of service.

     --apple-connect
             Connects the socket to the destination address.  This option is an
             Apple addition.

     --apple-time
             Prints the time a packet was received.  This option is an Apple
             addition.

     When using ping for fault isolation, it should first be run on the local
     host, to verify that the local network interface is up and running.  Then,
     hosts and gateways further and further away should be ``pinged''.  Round-
     trip times and packet loss statistics are computed.  If duplicate packets
     are received, they are not included in the packet loss calculation, although
     the round trip time of these packets is used in calculating the round-trip
     time statistics.  When the specified number of packets have been sent (and
     received) or if the program is terminated with a SIGINT, a brief summary is
     displayed, showing the number of packets sent and received, and the minimum,
     mean, maximum, and standard deviation of the round-trip times.

     If ping receives a SIGINFO (see the status argument for stty(1)) signal, the
     current number of packets sent and received, and the minimum, mean, and max-
     imum of the round-trip times will be written to the standard error output.

     This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and manage-
     ment.  Because of the load it can impose on the network, it is unwise to use
     ping during normal operations or from automated scripts.

ICMP PACKET DETAILS
     An IP header without options is 20 bytes.  An ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packet con-
     tains an additional 8 bytes worth of ICMP header followed by an arbitrary
     amount of data.  When a packetsize is given, this indicated the size of this
     extra piece of data (the default is 56).  Thus the amount of data received
     inside of an IP packet of type ICMP ECHO_REPLY will always be 8 bytes more
     than the requested data space (the ICMP header).

     If the data space is at least eight bytes large, ping uses the first eight
     bytes of this space to include a timestamp which it uses in the computation
     of round trip times.  If less than eight bytes of pad are specified, no
     round trip times are given.

DUPLICATE AND DAMAGED PACKETS
     The ping utility will report duplicate and damaged packets.  Duplicate pack-
     ets should never occur when pinging a unicast address, and seem to be caused
     by inappropriate link-level retransmissions.  Duplicates may occur in many
     situations and are rarely (if ever) a good sign, although the presence of
     low levels of duplicates may not always be cause for alarm.  Duplicates are
     expected when pinging a broadcast or multicast address, since they are not
     really duplicates but replies from different hosts to the same request.

     Damaged packets are obviously serious cause for alarm and often indicate
     broken hardware somewhere in the ping packet's path (in the network or in
     the hosts).

TRYING DIFFERENT DATA PATTERNS
     The (inter)network layer should never treat packets differently depending on
     the data contained in the data portion.  Unfortunately, data-dependent prob-
     lems have been known to sneak into networks and remain undetected for long
     periods of time.  In many cases the particular pattern that will have prob-
     lems is something that does not have sufficient ``transitions'', such as all
     ones or all zeros, or a pattern right at the edge, such as almost all zeros.
     It is not necessarily enough to specify a data pattern of all zeros (for
     example) on the command line because the pattern that is of interest is at
     the data link level, and the relationship between what you type and what the
     controllers transmit can be complicated.

     This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you will probably have
     to do a lot of testing to find it.  If you are lucky, you may manage to find
     a file that either cannot be sent across your network or that takes much
     longer to transfer than other similar length files.  You can then examine

   3   │ # Hi There!

   5   │ # You may be wondering what this giant blob of binary data here is, you might
   6   │ # even be worried that we're up to something nefarious (good for you for being
   7   │ # paranoid!). This is a base85 encoding of a zip file, this zip file contains
   8   │ # an entire copy of pip (version 20.3.4).
   9   │ #
  10   │ # Pip is a thing that installs packages, pip itself is a package that someone
  11   │ # might want to install, especially if they're looking to run this get-pip.py
  12   │ # script. Pip has a lot of code to deal with the security of installing
  13   │ # packages, various edge cases on various platforms, and other such sort of
  14   │ # "tribal knowledge" that has been encoded in its code base. Because of this
  15   │ # we basically include an entire copy of pip inside this blob. We do this
  16   │ # because the alternatives are attempt to implement a "minipip" that probably
  17   │ # doesn't do things correctly and has weird edge cases, or compress pip itself
  18   │ # down into a single file.
  19   │ #
  20   │ # If you're wondering how this is created, it is generated using
  21   │ # `scripts/generate.py` in https://github.com/pypa/get-pip.

==> Pouring curl--7.82.0.big_sur.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
curl is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have curl first in your PATH, run:
  fish_add_path /usr/local/opt/curl/bin

For compilers to find curl you may need to set:
  set -gx LDFLAGS "-L/usr/local/opt/curl/lib"
  set -gx CPPFLAGS "-I/usr/local/opt/curl/include"

For pkg-config to find curl you may need to set:
  set -gx PKG_CONFIG_PATH "/usr/local/opt/curl/lib/pkgconfig"

Docroot is: /usr/local/var/www

The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/.

To restart nginx after an upgrade:

For compilers to find curl you may need to set:
  set -gx LDFLAGS "-L/usr/local/opt/curl/lib"
  set -gx CPPFLAGS "-I/usr/local/opt/curl/include"

For pkg-config to find curl you may need to set:
  set -gx PKG_CONFIG_PATH "/usr/local/opt/curl/lib/pkgconfig"

Docroot is: /usr/local/var/www

The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/.

To restart nginx after an upgrade:
  brew services restart nginx
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:

BREW(1)                                brew                               BREW(1)

NAME
       brew - The Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux)

SYNOPSIS
       brew --version
       brew command [--verbose|-v] [options] [formula] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Homebrew  is  the  easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools
       Apple didn't include with macOS. It can also install software not packaged
       for your Linux distribution to your home directory without requiring sudo.

TERMINOLOGY
       formula
           Homebrew package definition built from upstream sources

       cask
           Homebrew package definition that installs macOS native applications

       keg
           installation destination directory of a  given  formula  version  e.g.
       /usr/local/Cellar/foo/0.1

       rack
           directory  containing  one or more versioned kegs e.g. /usr/local/Cel-
       lar/foo

       keg-only
           a formula is keg-only if it is not symlinked  into  Homebrew's  prefix
       (e.g. /usr/local)

       cellar
           directory containing one or more named racks e.g. /usr/local/Cellar

       Caskroom
           directory containing one or more named casks e.g. /usr/local/Caskroom

       external command
           brew subcommand defined outside of the Homebrew/brew GitHub repository

       tap
           directory (and usually  Git  repository)  of  formulae,  casks  and/or
       external commands

       bottle
           pre-built  keg  poured  into  the cellar/rack instead of building from
       upstream sources

ESSENTIAL COMMANDS
       For the full command list, see the COMMANDS section.

       With --verbose or --debug, many commands print  extra  debugging  informa-
       tion. Note that these options should only appear after a command.

       Some  command  behaviour can be customised with environment variables; see
       the ENVIRONMENT section.

   install formula
       Install formula.

       formula is usually the name of the formula to install, but  it  has  other
       syntaxes which are listed in the SPECIFYING FORMULAE section.

   uninstall formula
       Uninstall formula.

   list
       List all installed formulae.

   search [text|/text/]
       Perform  a  substring search of cask tokens and formula names for text. If
       text is flanked by slashes, it is interpreted as a regular expression. The
       search  for text is extended online to homebrew/core and homebrew/cask. If
       no search term is provided, all locally available formulae are listed.

COMMANDS
   analytics [subcommand]

              in the output.

       --installed
              List  dependencies  for  formulae  that are currently installed. If
              formula is specified, list only its dependencies that are currently
              installed.

       --all  List dependencies for all available formulae.

       --for-each
              Switch into the mode used by the --all option, but only list depen-

       --cask Treat all named arguments as casks.

   desc [options] formula|cask|text|/regex/ [...]
       Display  formula's name and one-line description. Formula descriptions are
       cached; the cache is created on  the  first  search,  making  that  search
       slower than subsequent ones.

       -s, --search
              Search  both names and descriptions for text. If text is flanked by
              slashes, it is interpreted as a regular expression.

       -n, --name
              Search just names for text. If text is flanked by  slashes,  it  is
              interpreted as a regular expression.

              Treat all named arguments as formulae.

       --cask Treat all named arguments as casks.

   developer [subcommand]
       Control Homebrew's developer mode. When developer mode  is  enabled,  brew

       instead of the latest stable  version  along  with  some  other  behaviour
       changes.

       brew developer [state]
           Display the current state of Homebrew's developer mode.

       brew developer (on|off)
           Turn Homebrew's developer mode on or off respectively.

   doctor, dr [--list-checks] [--audit-debug] [diagnostic_check ...]
       Check your system for potential problems. Will exit with a non-zero status
       if any potential problems are found. Please note that these  warnings  are
       just  used  to help the Homebrew maintainers with debugging if you file an
       issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is working  fine:  please  don't
       worry or file an issue; just ignore this.

       --list-checks
              List  all  audit methods, which can be run individually if provided
              as arguments.

       -D, --audit-debug
              Enable debugging and profiling of audit methods.

   fetch [options] formula|cask [...]

       -v, --verbose
              Do  a  verbose  VCS  checkout, if the URL represents a VCS. This is
              useful for seeing if an existing VCS cache has been updated.

       --retry
              Retry if downloading fails or re-download if the checksum of a pre-
              viously cached version no longer matches.

       --deps Also download dependencies for any listed formula.

       -s, --build-from-source
              Download source packages rather than a bottle.

       --build-bottle
              Download source packages (for eventual bottling) rather than a bot-
              tle.

       --force-bottle
              Download a bottle if it exists for the current or newest version of
              macOS, even if it would not be used during installation.

       --[no-]quarantine
              Disable/enable quarantining of downloads (default: enabled).

   install [options] formula|cask [...]
       Install a formula or cask. Additional options specific to a formula may be
       appended to the command.

       Unless HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALLED_DEPENDENTS_CHECK is set, brew upgrade or brew
       reinstall  will  be run for outdated dependents and dependents with broken
       linkage, respectively.

       Unless HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP is set, brew cleanup will then  be  run
       for the installed formulae or, every 30 days, for all formulae.

       Unless  HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_UPGRADE  is  set,  brew install <formula> will
       upgrade formula if it is already installed but outdated.

       -d, --debug
              If brewing fails, open an interactive debugging session with access
              to IRB or a shell inside the temporary build directory.

       -f, --force
              Install formulae without checking for previously installed keg-only
              or non-migrated versions. When installing casks, overwrite existing
              files  (binaries  and symlinks are excluded, unless originally from
              the same cask).

       -v, --verbose

       --ignore-dependencies
              An unsupported Homebrew development flag  to  skip  installing  any
              dependencies  of  any  kind.  If  the  dependencies are not already
              present, the formula will have issues.  If  you're  not  developing
              Homebrew, consider adjusting your PATH rather than using this flag.

       --only-dependencies
              Install the dependencies with specified options but do not  install
              the formula itself.

       --cc   Attempt  to  compile  using the specified compiler, which should be
              the name of the compiler's executable, e.g. gcc-7  for  GCC  7.  In
              order   to  use  LLVM's  clang,  specify  llvm_clang.  To  use  the
              Apple-provided clang, specify clang. This option will  only  accept
              compilers  that  are  provided  by  Homebrew or bundled with macOS.
              Please do not file issues if you encounter errors while using  this
              option.

       -s, --build-from-source
              Compile formula from source even if a bottle is provided. Dependen-
              cies will still be installed from bottles if they are available.

       --force-bottle
              Install from a bottle if it exists for the current or  newest  ver-
              sion  of macOS, even if it would not normally be used for installa-
              tion.

       --include-test
              Install testing dependencies required to run brew test formula.

       --HEAD If formula defines it, install the HEAD version, aka. main,  trunk,
              unstable, master.

       --fetch-HEAD
              Fetch the upstream repository to detect if the HEAD installation of
              the formula is outdated. Otherwise, the repository's HEAD will only
              be checked for updates when a new stable or development version has
              been released.

       --keep-tmp
              Retain the temporary files created during installation.

       --build-bottle
              Prepare the formula  for  eventual  bottling  during  installation,
              skipping any post-install steps.

       --bottle-arch
              Optimise  bottles  for  the  specified architecture rather than the
              oldest architecture supported by the version of macOS  the  bottles
              are built on.

       --display-times
              Print install times for each package at the end of the run.

       -i, --interactive
              Download and patch formula, then open a shell. This allows the user
              to run ./configure --help and otherwise determine how to  turn  the
              software package into a Homebrew package.

       -g, --git
              Create  a  Git repository, useful for creating patches to the soft-
              ware.

       --overwrite
              Delete files that already exist in the prefix while linking.

       --cask Treat all named arguments as casks.

       --require-sha
              Require all casks to have a checksum.

       --[no-]quarantine
              Disable/enable quarantining of downloads (default: enabled).

       --skip-cask-deps
              Skip installing cask dependencies.

       --zap  For use with brew reinstall --cask.  Remove  all  files  associated
              with  a  cask.  May  remove files which are shared between applica-
              tions.

   leaves [--installed-on-request] [--installed-as-dependency]

              Only list leaves that were manually installed.

       -p, --installed-as-dependency
              Only list leaves that were installed as dependencies.

   link, ln [options] installed_formula [...]
       Symlink  all  of formula's installed files into Homebrew's prefix. This is
       done automatically when you install formulae but can  be  useful  for  DIY
       installations.

       --overwrite
              Delete files that already exist in the prefix while linking.

       -n, --dry-run

              write without actually linking or deleting any files.

       -f, --force
              Allow keg-only formulae to be linked.

...skipping...
       transport protocol that git(1) handles. The one-argument form of tap  sim-
       plifies  but  also limits. This two-argument command makes no assumptions,
       so taps can be cloned from places other than GitHub  and  using  protocols
       other than HTTPS, e.g. SSH, git, HTTP, FTP(S), rsync.

       --force-auto-update
              Auto-update  tap  even  if  it is not hosted on GitHub. By default,
              only taps hosted on GitHub are auto-updated (for  performance  rea-
              sons).

       --custom-remote
              Install or change a tap with a custom remote. Useful for mirrors.

              List all pinned taps.

   tap-info [--installed] [--json] [tap ...]
       Show detailed information about one or more taps.

       If no tap names are provided, display brief statistics for  all  installed
       taps.

       --installed
              Show information on each installed tap.

       --json Print  a JSON representation of tap. Currently the default and only
              accepted value for version is v1. See  the  docs  for  examples  of
              using the JSON output: https://docs.brew.sh/Querying-Brew

   uninstall, remove, rm [options] installed_formula|installed_cask [...]
       Uninstall a formula or cask.

       -f, --force
              Delete all installed versions of formula. Uninstall even if cask is
              not installed, overwrite existing  files  and  ignore  errors  when
              removing files.

       --zap  Remove all files associated with a cask. May remove files which are
              shared between applications.

       --ignore-dependencies
              Don't fail uninstall, even  if  formula  is  a  dependency  of  any
              installed formulae.

       --formula
              Treat all named arguments as formulae.

       --cask Treat all named arguments as casks.

   unlink [--dry-run] installed_formula [...]

       temporarily disabling a formula: brew unlink formula && commands  &&  brew
       link formula

       -n, --dry-run
              List  files  which  would be unlinked without actually unlinking or
              deleting any files.

   unpin installed_formula [...]
       Unpin formula, allowing them to be upgraded by brew upgrade  formula.  See
       also pin.

   untap [--force] tap [...]
       Remove a tapped formula repository.

       -f, --force
              Untap  even  if  formulae  or  casks  from  this  tap are currently
              installed.

   update [options]
       Fetch the newest version of Homebrew and all formulae  from  GitHub  using
       git(1) and perform any necessary migrations.

       --merge
              Use git merge to apply updates (rather than git rebase).

       --preinstall
              Run  on  auto-updates (e.g. before brew install). Skips some slower
              steps.

       -f, --force
              Always do a slower, full update check (even if unnecessary).

   update-reset [repository ...]
       Fetch and reset Homebrew and all tap repositories (or any specified repos-
       itory) using git(1) to their latest origin/HEAD.

       Note: this will destroy all your uncommitted or committed changes.

   upgrade [options] [outdated_formula|outdated_cask ...]
       Upgrade  outdated  casks  and  outdated,  unpinned formulae using the same
       options they were originally installed with, plus any appended  brew  for-
       mula  options.  If  cask  or formula are specified, upgrade only the given
       cask or formula kegs (unless they are pinned; see pin, unpin).

       Unless HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALLED_DEPENDENTS_CHECK is set, brew upgrade or brew
       reinstall  will  be run for outdated dependents and dependents with broken
       linkage, respectively.

       Unless HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP is set, brew cleanup will then  be  run
       for the upgraded formulae or, every 30 days, for all formulae.

       -d, --debug
              If brewing fails, open an interactive debugging session with access
              to IRB or a shell inside the temporary build directory.

       -f, --force
              Install formulae without checking for previously installed keg-only
              or non-migrated versions. When installing casks, overwrite existing
              files (binaries and symlinks are excluded, unless  originally  from
              the same cask).

       -v, --verbose
              Print the verification and postinstall steps.

       -n, --dry-run
              Show  what would be upgraded, but do not actually upgrade anything.

       --formula
              Treat all named arguments as formulae. If no  named  arguments  are
              specified, upgrade only outdated formulae.

              Compile formula from source even if a bottle is available.

       -i, --interactive
              Download and patch formula, then open a shell. This allows the user
              to run ./configure --help and otherwise determine how to  turn  the
              software package into a Homebrew package.

       --force-bottle
              Install  from  a bottle if it exists for the current or newest ver-
              sion of macOS, even if it would not normally be used for  installa-
              tion.

       --fetch-HEAD
              Fetch the upstream repository to detect if the HEAD installation of
              the formula is outdated. Otherwise, the repository's HEAD will only
              be checked for updates when a new stable or development version has
              been released.

       --ignore-pinned
              Set a successful exit  status  even  if  pinned  formulae  are  not
              upgraded.

       --keep-tmp
              Retain the temporary files created during installation.

       --display-times
              Print install times for each package at the end of the run.

       --cask Treat all named arguments as casks. If no named arguments are spec-
              ified, upgrade only outdated casks.

NAME
       brew - The Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux)

SYNOPSIS
       brew --version
       brew command [--verbose|-v] [options] [formula] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Homebrew  is  the  easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools
       Apple didn't include with macOS. It can also install software not packaged
       for your Linux distribution to your home directory without requiring sudo.

TERMINOLOGY
       formula
           Homebrew package definition built from upstream sources

       cask
           Homebrew package definition that installs macOS native applications

       keg
           installation destination directory of a  given  formula  version  e.g.
       /usr/local/Cellar/foo/0.1

       rack
           directory  containing  one or more versioned kegs e.g. /usr/local/Cel-
       lar/foo

       keg-only
           a formula is keg-only if it is not symlinked  into  Homebrew's  prefix
       (e.g. /usr/local)

       cellar
           directory containing one or more named racks e.g. /usr/local/Cellar

       Caskroom
           directory containing one or more named casks e.g. /usr/local/Caskroom

       external command
           brew subcommand defined outside of the Homebrew/brew GitHub repository

       tap
           directory (and usually  Git  repository)  of  formulae,  casks  and/or
       external commands

       bottle
           pre-built  keg  poured  into  the cellar/rack instead of building from
       upstream sources

ESSENTIAL COMMANDS
       For the full command list, see the COMMANDS section.

       With --verbose or --debug, many commands print  extra  debugging  informa-
       tion. Note that these options should only appear after a command.

       Some  command  behaviour can be customised with environment variables; see
       the ENVIRONMENT section.

   install formula
       Install formula.

       formula is usually the name of the formula to install, but  it  has  other
       syntaxes which are listed in the SPECIFYING FORMULAE section.

   uninstall formula
       Uninstall formula.

   list
       List all installed formulae.

   search [text|/text/]
       Perform  a  substring search of cask tokens and formula names for text. If
       text is flanked by slashes, it is interpreted as a regular expression. The
       search  for text is extended online to homebrew/core and homebrew/cask. If
       no search term is provided, all locally available formulae are listed.

COMMANDS
   analytics [subcommand]

       List all locally installable casks including short names.

   cleanup [options] [formula|cask ...]
       Remove stale lock files and outdated downloads for all formulae and casks,
       and remove old versions of installed formulae. If arguments are specified,
       only  do this for the given formulae and casks. Removes all downloads more
       than   120   days   old.    This    can    be    adjusted    with    HOME-
       BREW_CLEANUP_MAX_AGE_DAYS.

       --prune
              Remove  all  cache  files older than specified days. If you want to
              remove everything, use --prune=all.

              not be deleted. If you want to delete those  too:  rm  -rf  "$(brew
              --cache)"

       --prune-prefix

   deps [options] [formula|cask ...]
       Show dependencies for formula. Additional options specific to formula  may
       be  appended  to  the command. When given multiple formula arguments, show
       the intersection of dependencies for each formula.

       -n     Sort dependencies in topological order.

       --1    Only show dependencies one level down, instead of recursing.

       --union
              Show the union of dependencies for multiple formula, instead of the
              intersection.

       --full-name
              List dependencies by their full name.

       --include-build

              in the output.

       --installed
              List  dependencies  for  formulae  that are currently installed. If
              formula is specified, list only its dependencies that are currently
              installed.

       --all  List dependencies for all available formulae.

       --for-each
              Switch into the mode used by the --all option, but only list depen-
              dencies for each provided formula, one formula per  line.  This  is
              used for debugging the --installed/--all display mode.

       --formula
              Treat all named arguments as formulae.

       --cask Treat all named arguments as casks.

   desc [options] formula|cask|text|/regex/ [...]
       Display  formula's name and one-line description. Formula descriptions are
       cached; the cache is created on  the  first  search,  making  that  search
       slower than subsequent ones.

       -s, --search
              Search  both names and descriptions for text. If text is flanked by
              slashes, it is interpreted as a regular expression.

       -n, --name
              Search just names for text. If text is flanked by  slashes,  it  is
              interpreted as a regular expression.

       -d, --description
              Search  just  descriptions for text. If text is flanked by slashes,
              it is interpreted as a regular expression.

       --formula
              Treat all named arguments as formulae.

       --cask Treat all named arguments as casks.

   developer [subcommand]
       Control Homebrew's developer mode. When developer mode  is  enabled,  brew
       update  will  update  Homebrew  to  the latest commit on the master branch
       instead of the latest stable  version  along  with  some  other  behaviour
       changes.

       brew developer [state]
           Display the current state of Homebrew's developer mode.

       brew developer (on|off)
           Turn Homebrew's developer mode on or off respectively.

   doctor, dr [--list-checks] [--audit-debug] [diagnostic_check ...]
       Check your system for potential problems. Will exit with a non-zero status
       if any potential problems are found. Please note that these  warnings  are
       just  used  to help the Homebrew maintainers with debugging if you file an
       issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is working  fine:  please  don't
       worry or file an issue; just ignore this.

       --list-checks
              List  all  audit methods, which can be run individually if provided
              as arguments.

       -D, --audit-debug
              Enable debugging and profiling of audit methods.

   fetch [options] formula|cask [...]
       Download a bottle (if available) or source packages for formulae and bina-
       ries for casks. For files, also print SHA-256 checksums.

       --bottle-tag
              Download a bottle for given tag.

       --HEAD Fetch HEAD version instead of stable version.

       -f, --force
              Remove a previously cached version and re-fetch.

       -v, --verbose
              Do  a  verbose  VCS  checkout, if the URL represents a VCS. This is
              useful for seeing if an existing VCS cache has been updated.

       --retry
              Retry if downloading fails or re-download if the checksum of a pre-
              viously cached version no longer matches.

       --deps Also download dependencies for any listed formula.

       -s, --build-from-source
              Download source packages rather than a bottle.

       --build-bottle
              Download source packages (for eventual bottling) rather than a bot-
              tle.

       --ignore-dependencies
              An unsupported Homebrew development flag  to  skip  installing  any
              dependencies  of  any  kind.  If  the  dependencies are not already
              present, the formula will have issues.  If  you're  not  developing
              Homebrew, consider adjusting your PATH rather than using this flag.

       --only-dependencies
              Install the dependencies with specified options but do not  install
              the formula itself.

       --cc   Attempt  to  compile  using the specified compiler, which should be
              the name of the compiler's executable, e.g. gcc-7  for  GCC  7.  In
              order   to  use  LLVM's  clang,  specify  llvm_clang.  To  use  the
              Apple-provided clang, specify clang. This option will  only  accept
              compilers  that  are  provided  by  Homebrew or bundled with macOS.
              Please do not file issues if you encounter errors while using  this
              option.

       -s, --build-from-source
              Compile formula from source even if a bottle is provided. Dependen-

       --fetch-HEAD
              Fetch the upstream repository to detect if the HEAD installation of
              the formula is outdated. Otherwise, the repository's HEAD will only

              been released.

       --keep-tmp
              Retain the temporary files created during installation.

       --build-bottle

              Only list leaves that were installed as dependencies.

   link, ln [options] installed_formula [...]
       Symlink  all  of formula's installed files into Homebrew's prefix. This is
       done automatically when you install formulae but can  be  useful  for  DIY
       installations.

       packages.

       -f, --force
              Treat  installed  formula  and provided formula as if they are from
              the same taps and migrate them anyway.

       -n, --dry-run
              Show what would be migrated, but do not actually migrate  anything.

   missing [--hide=] [formula ...]
       Check  the  given formula kegs for missing dependencies. If no formula are
       provided, check all kegs. Will exit with a non-zero status if any kegs are
       found to be missing dependencies.

       --hide Act as if none of the specified hidden are installed. hidden should
              be a comma-separated list of formulae.

              fied. v2 prints outdated formulae and casks.

       --fetch-HEAD
              Fetch the upstream repository to detect if the HEAD installation of
              the formula is outdated. Otherwise, the repository's HEAD will only

   shellenv
       Print  export  statements. When run in a shell, this installation of Home-
       brew will be added to your PATH, MANPATH, and INFOPATH.

       The variables HOMEBREW_PREFIX, HOMEBREW_CELLAR and HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY are
       also  exported  to  avoid  querying them multiple times. To help guarantee
       idempotence, this command produces no output when Homebrew's bin and  sbin
       directories  are  first  and  second  respectively  in your PATH. Consider
       adding evaluation of this command's output to your dotfiles (e.g.  ~/.pro-
       file, ~/.bash_profile, or ~/.zprofile) with: eval "$(brew shellenv)"

   tap [options] [user/repo] [URL]
       Tap a formula repository.

       If no arguments are provided, list all installed taps.

       With  URL  unspecified,  tap a formula repository from GitHub using HTTPS.
       Since so many taps are hosted on GitHub, this command is  a  shortcut  for
       brew tap user/repo https://github.com/user/homebrew-repo.

       With  URL  specified,  tap  a  formula repository from anywhere, using any
       transport protocol that git(1) handles. The one-argument form of tap  sim-
       plifies  but  also limits. This two-argument command makes no assumptions,
       so taps can be cloned from places other than GitHub  and  using  protocols
       other than HTTPS, e.g. SSH, git, HTTP, FTP(S), rsync.

       --force-auto-update
              Auto-update  tap  even  if  it is not hosted on GitHub. By default,
              only taps hosted on GitHub are auto-updated (for  performance  rea-
              sons).

       --custom-remote
              Install or change a tap with a custom remote. Useful for mirrors.

       --repair
              Migrate  tapped  formulae  from  symlink-based  to  directory-based
              structure.

       --list-pinned
              List all pinned taps.

   tap-info [--installed] [--json] [tap ...]
       Show detailed information about one or more taps.

       If no tap names are provided, display brief statistics for  all  installed
       taps.

       --installed
              Show information on each installed tap.

       --json Print  a JSON representation of tap. Currently the default and only
              accepted value for version is v1. See  the  docs  for  examples  of
              using the JSON output: https://docs.brew.sh/Querying-Brew

       Uninstall a formula or cask.

       -f, --force
              Delete all installed versions of formula. Uninstall even if cask is
              not installed, overwrite existing  files  and  ignore  errors  when
              removing files.

       --zap  Remove all files associated with a cask. May remove files which are
              shared between applications.

       --ignore-dependencies
              Don't fail uninstall, even  if  formula  is  a  dependency  of  any
              installed formulae.

       --formula
              Treat all named arguments as formulae.

       --cask Treat all named arguments as casks.

   unlink [--dry-run] installed_formula [...]
       Remove symlinks for formula from Homebrew's prefix. This can be useful for
       temporarily disabling a formula: brew unlink formula && commands  &&  brew
       link formula

       -n, --dry-run
              List  files  which  would be unlinked without actually unlinking or
              deleting any files.

   unpin installed_formula [...]
       Unpin formula, allowing them to be upgraded by brew upgrade  formula.  See
       also pin.

   untap [--force] tap [...]
       Remove a tapped formula repository.

       -f, --force
              Untap  even  if  formulae  or  casks  from  this  tap are currently
              installed.

   update [options]
       Fetch the newest version of Homebrew and all formulae  from  GitHub  using
       git(1) and perform any necessary migrations.

       --merge
              Use git merge to apply updates (rather than git rebase).

       --preinstall
              Run  on  auto-updates (e.g. before brew install). Skips some slower
              steps.

       -f, --force
              Always do a slower, full update check (even if unnecessary).

   update-reset [repository ...]
       Fetch and reset Homebrew and all tap repositories (or any specified repos-
       itory) using git(1) to their latest origin/HEAD.

       Note: this will destroy all your uncommitted or committed changes.

   upgrade [options] [outdated_formula|outdated_cask ...]
       Upgrade  outdated  casks  and  outdated,  unpinned formulae using the same
       options they were originally installed with, plus any appended  brew  for-
       mula  options.  If  cask  or formula are specified, upgrade only the given
       cask or formula kegs (unless they are pinned; see pin, unpin).

       Unless HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALLED_DEPENDENTS_CHECK is set, brew upgrade or brew
       reinstall  will  be run for outdated dependents and dependents with broken
       linkage, respectively.

       Unless HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP is set, brew cleanup will then  be  run
       for the upgraded formulae or, every 30 days, for all formulae.

       -d, --debug
              If brewing fails, open an interactive debugging session with access
              to IRB or a shell inside the temporary build directory.

       -f, --force
              Install formulae without checking for previously installed keg-only
              or non-migrated versions. When installing casks, overwrite existing
              files (binaries and symlinks are excluded, unless  originally  from
              the same cask).

       -v, --verbose
              Print the verification and postinstall steps.

       -n, --dry-run
              Show  what would be upgraded, but do not actually upgrade anything.

       --formula
              Treat all named arguments as formulae. If no  named  arguments  are
              specified, upgrade only outdated formulae.

       -s, --build-from-source
              Compile formula from source even if a bottle is available.

       -i, --interactive
              Download and patch formula, then open a shell. This allows the user
              to run ./configure --help and otherwise determine how to  turn  the
              software package into a Homebrew package.

       --force-bottle
              Install  from  a bottle if it exists for the current or newest ver-
              sion of macOS, even if it would not normally be used for  installa-
              tion.

       --fetch-HEAD
              Fetch the upstream repository to detect if the HEAD installation of
              the formula is outdated. Otherwise, the repository's HEAD will only
              be checked for updates when a new stable or development version has
              been released.

       --ignore-pinned
              Set a successful exit  status  even  if  pinned  formulae  are  not
              upgraded.

       --keep-tmp
              Retain the temporary files created during installation.

       --display-times
              Print install times for each package at the end of the run.

       --cask Treat all named arguments as casks. If no named arguments are spec-
              ified, upgrade only outdated casks.

       --[no-]binaries
              Disable/enable linking of helper executables (default: enabled).

       --require-sha
              Require all casks to have a checksum.

       --[no-]quarantine
              Disable/enable quarantining of downloads (default: enabled).

       --skip-cask-deps
              Skip installing cask dependencies.

       --greedy
              Also include casks with auto_updates true or version :latest.

       --greedy-latest
              Also include casks with version :latest.

       --greedy-auto-updates
              Also include casks with auto_updates true.

   uses [options] formula [...]
       Show formulae and casks that specify formula as  a  dependency;  that  is,
       show  dependents  of  formula. When given multiple formula arguments, show
       the intersection of formulae that use formula. By default, uses shows  all
       formulae  and  casks  that  specify  formula  as a required or recommended
       dependency for their stable builds.

       --recursive
              Resolve more than one level of dependencies.

       --installed
              Only list formulae and casks that are currently installed.

       --include-build

              dency.

       --formula
              Include only formulae.

       --cask Include only casks.

   --cache [options] [formula|cask ...]

       be installed, without any sort of versioned directory as the last path.

   --cellar [formula ...]
       Display Homebrew's Cellar path. Default: $(brew  --prefix)/Cellar,  or  if
       that directory doesn't exist, $(brew --repository)/Cellar.

       would be installed, without any sort of versioned directory  as  the  last
       path.

   --env, environment [--shell=] [--plain] [formula ...]
       Summarise Homebrew's build environment as a plain list.

==> Caveats
opencv@2 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have opencv@2 first in your PATH, run:
  fish_add_path /usr/local/opt/opencv@2/bin

For compilers to find opencv@2 you may need to set:
  set -gx LDFLAGS "-L/usr/local/opt/opencv@2/lib"
  set -gx CPPFLAGS "-I/usr/local/opt/opencv@2/include"

For pkg-config to find opencv@2 you may need to set:
  set -gx PKG_CONFIG_PATH "/usr/local/opt/opencv@2/lib/pkgconfig"

~/dev/etc/willwhitney-live-earth-desktop ❯ brew help test       on master  5m36s 07:35:16
Usage: brew test [options] installed_formula [...]

Run the test method provided by an installed formula. There is no standard
output or return code, but generally it should notify the user if something is
wrong with the installed formula.

Example: brew install jruby && brew test jruby

  -f, --force                      Test formulae even if they are unlinked.
      --HEAD                       Test the head version of a formula.
      --keep-tmp                   Retain the temporary files created for the
                                   test.
      --retry                      Retry if a testing fails.
  -d, --debug                      Display any debugging information.
  -q, --quiet                      Make some output more quiet.
  -v, --verbose                    Make some output more verbose.
